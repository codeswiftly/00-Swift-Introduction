A Swift Introduction To Programming.

##Overview

This repo is here to help you learn the basics of computer programming. We will learn how to:

* Begin instructing the computer to perform your commands.
* Perform basic math operations.
* Perform basic text manipulation.
* Organize sets of information.

##What is Programming and why Swift?

Creating an Application, requires specifically instructing the CPU what actions to take. In order to to communicate with the CPU, you must learn the grammar of a computer programming language. In the past, computer languages were chosen due to trends, performance characteristics and, quite frankly, old habits. The Swift Programming Language replaces Objective-C as the favored way to develop new applications for Mac and iOS devices. It is easier to write, faster and builds on a wealth of computer science research making Swift a great first language.

##Writing Your first line of Swift

In order to instruct the computer you need an interpreter that takes your input and transform it into something that machines can understand. This is commonly referred to as a Read, Evaluate, and Print Loop (REPL for short). The Swift REPL is accessible through any Mac via the application called Terminal. Launch Terminal and type the following command and press the "Enter" key.

```
swift
```

You should see the follow response.

Now that the interpreter is running, you can enter your first command. As a first instruction, it is customary to instruct the computer to reply, "Hello World!" In Swift, this is done via the following command:

```
println("Hello World!")
```

If all is well, the computer should reply:

```
Hello World!
```
