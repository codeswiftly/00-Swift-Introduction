A Swift Introduction To Programming.

##What is Programming and why Swift?

Creating a computer program, or an Application, requires telling a computer exactly on what actions it should take. Specifically, you are instructing the CPU what actions to take. In order to to communicate with the CPU, you must learn the grammar of a computer programming language. In the past, computer languages were chosen chosen due to trends, performance characteristics and, quite frankly, old habits. The Swift Programming Language replaces Objective-C as the favored way to develop new applications for Mac and iOS devices. It is easier to write, faster and builds on a wealth of sound computer science research.

##Writing Your first line of Swift

In order to instruct the computer you need an interpreter to take your input and transform it into something that machines can understand. The Swift Interpreter is accessible through any Mac via the application called Terminal. Open Terminal and type the following followed by the "Enter" key.

```
swift
```

You should see the follow response.

```
Welcome to Swift!  Type :help for assistance.
```

Now that the interpreter is running, you can enter your first command.
